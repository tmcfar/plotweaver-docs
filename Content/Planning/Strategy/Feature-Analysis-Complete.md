### Specialized Systems (3 features)
Domain-specific systems for particular use cases or advanced capabilities.

**Features:**

**Example Progressive Setting (ID: 23)** - Template/example implementation of progressive setting system enabling "just-in-time" setting development, starting with genre-appropriate defaults and expanding naturally during writing while maintaining consistency.

**Elastic Agent Architecture (EVAL-002)** - Dynamic agent spawning based on project complexity, allowing PlotWeaver to scale computational resources precisely to match story needs instead of fixed agent assignments. Evaluation recommends deferring due to complexity concerns.

**Prompt Customization (EVAL-003)** - User-owned prompt customization and reference management system allowing users to customize AI prompts and model selection directly in their GitHub repository. Evaluation recommends rejecting due to complexity and scope concerns.

**Component Analysis:**
- **Mixed Priority**: Range from template examples to rejected features
- **Advanced Capabilities**: Features represent sophisticated but non-essential functionality
- **Future Considerations**: Elastic architecture deferred, prompt customization rejected

## Strategic Recommendations

### Next Steps for Implementation Planning
1. **Conduct detailed technical analysis** to determine actual implementation effort and dependencies
2. **Establish feature prioritization criteria** based on user needs and business goals
3. **Create realistic timeline estimates** through technical specification and prototyping
4. **Validate complexity assessments** - current labels may not accurately reflect implementation effort

## Important Notes
- **No implementation phases or timelines are documented** in the feature files themselves
- **Complexity and priority estimates require validation** - current labels may not accurately reflect implementation effort  
- **Dependencies mentioned in features are general** - detailed dependency analysis needed for implementation planning
- **Cross-component relationships exist** but specific implementation order requires technical analysis
- Features marked as "Evaluation" require final approval before implementation
- Regular review recommended as user feedback influences priorities
