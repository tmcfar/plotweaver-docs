### Concurrency and Performance Patterns

#### Agent Execution Concurrency
- **Foundation Agents**: Sequential execution (concept → plot → characters)
- **Quality Agents**: Parallel execution for performance optimization
- **Content Generation**: Pipeline execution with dependency management

#### Resource Management
- **Connection Pooling**: OpenRouter API connections managed with rate limiting
- **Memory Management**: Agent context isolation and cleanup
- **Error Recovery**: Circuit breakers and exponential backoff for external services

#### Performance Characteristics
- **Throughput**: 5-10 scenes per hour depending on complexity
- **Latency**: 2-5 minutes per scene generation cycle
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling through agent pool management
