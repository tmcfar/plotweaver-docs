# PlotWeaver Architecture Specification

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-29  
**Maintainer:** PlotWeaver Team  

## Overview

PlotWeaver is an AI-first collaborative manuscript dependency management platform that leverages a sophisticated multi-agent architecture to generate, enhance, and validate narrative content. This document serves as the master architecture specification, consolidating all architectural views and design decisions.

## Document Structure

This specification is organized into multiple detailed documents that together provide a complete architectural view:

### Core Specification Documents

1. **[4+1 Architectural Views](./4+1-View.md)** - Complete architectural perspectives using the 4+1 view model
2. **[Component Specifications](./components.yaml)** - Detailed component definitions and relationships
3. **[System Structure](./structure.yaml)** - Physical file structure and organization
4. **[Configuration Schema](./config.yaml)** - Configuration management and validation
5. **[Workflow Definitions](./workflows.yaml)** - Process flows and orchestration patterns

## Architecture Summary

### System Philosophy

PlotWeaver is built on the principle of **AI-first collaborative writing** with the following core tenets:

- **Agent-Driven Architecture**: Specialized AI agents handle distinct aspects of story creation
- **Quality-First Approach**: Iterative quality validation ensures narrative consistency
- **Git-Native Storage**: Version control as the foundation for collaboration and history
- **Contract-Based Integration**: YAML metadata contracts ensure component interoperability

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Multi-Agent Architecture

**Decision**: Implement specialized agents for different aspects of story creation rather than a monolithic AI system.

**Rationale**: 
- Enables focused expertise for each narrative domain
- Allows independent development and testing of capabilities
- Provides clear separation of concerns and responsibilities
- Facilitates parallel processing and quality validation

**Implementation**: 10 specialized agents organized into foundation, generation, and quality control layers.

### 2. Git-Native Storage

**Decision**: Use Git repositories as the primary storage and collaboration mechanism.

**Rationale**:
- Provides built-in version control and change tracking
- Enables natural collaboration workflows for writers
- Supports branching and merging for experimental content
- Integrates with existing developer and writer toolchains

**Implementation**: GitManager service handles all repository operations with atomic commits and metadata tracking.

### 3. YAML Metadata Contracts

**Decision**: Use YAML files for all metadata and inter-component communication.

**Rationale**:
- Human-readable format for writer accessibility
- Schema validation ensures data integrity
- Version control friendly (text-based, diff-able)
- Flexible structure for evolving requirements

**Implementation**: MetadataManager with comprehensive schema validation and contract enforcement.

### 4. Quality-First Generation Pipeline

**Decision**: Implement iterative quality validation as a core part of the generation process.

**Rationale**:
- Ensures consistent narrative quality across all content
- Catches issues early in the generation process
- Provides measurable quality metrics and improvement tracking
- Enables automated quality assurance at scale

**Implementation**: QualityLoop orchestrates 5 parallel quality agents with iterative improvement cycles.

### 5. OpenRouter Integration

**Decision**: Use OpenRouter as the primary LLM provider interface.

**Rationale**:
- Provides access to multiple AI models through a single API
- Enables model selection based on task requirements
- Reduces vendor lock-in and provides fallback options
- Simplifies rate limiting and cost management

**Implementation**: OpenRouterClient with connection pooling and circuit breaker patterns.
