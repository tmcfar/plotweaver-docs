## Feature Description

### Core Concept
Allow users to customize AI prompts and model selection directly in their GitHub repository, providing granular cost/quality control and enabling reference manuscript processing for series continuity.

### Key Components

1. **User-Owned Prompt Templates**
```yaml
# In user's repo: prompts/setting/world_physics.yaml
template_version: "1.2.3"
agent: "WorldPhysicsAgent"

system_prompt:
  # ⚠️ DO NOT MODIFY - Required for agent coordination
  role: "You are a world physics designer..."
  
user_content:
  # ✅ CUSTOMIZE THIS SECTION
  inspiration: |
    [User's custom worldbuilding instructions]
  constraints: |
    [User's specific limitations]

required_outputs:  # Contract with other agents
  - physics_rules: array
  - limitations: object
```

2. **Model Configuration Control**
```yaml
# .plotweaver/model_config.yaml
model_assignments:
  PlotAgent:
    model: "gpt-4-turbo"
    temperature: 0.8
    
  # Cost optimization - cheaper models for setting
  WorldPhysicsAgent:
    model: "gpt-3.5-turbo"
    temperature: 0.7
    
optimization:
  monthly_budget: 100.00
  fallback_model: "gpt-3.5-turbo"
```

3. **Reference Manuscript Processing**
```
user-book-repo/
├── reference/
│   ├── series/       # Extracted patterns from previous books
│   │   ├── book-1-patterns.json
│   │   └── series-bible.yaml
│   └── style-analysis/
│       └── author-voice-patterns.json
```

### Required Architecture Changes

1. **New Components**
```python
class PromptTemplateManager:
    """Load and validate user prompts"""
    
class ModelSelectionEngine:
    """Dynamic model selection per agent"""
    
class ReferenceProcessor:
    """Extract patterns from uploaded manuscripts"""
    
class CostTracker:
    """Real-time cost monitoring"""
```

2. **Git Repository Impact**
- Increased repo size from prompts and references
- Sync performance implications
- Storage costs passed to users

3. **Agent System Changes**
- Validation for custom prompts
- Fallback mechanisms
- Compatibility checking

## Detailed Analysis

### Core Benefits

1. **Legal Protection**
   - User owns all creative customizations
   - PlotWeaver executes user instructions only
   - Clear IP separation

2. **Cost Control**
   - Granular model selection per agent
   - Budget enforcement
   - Transparent pricing

3. **Power User Features**
   - Deep prompt customization
   - Series continuity from uploaded references
   - Version controlled prompt evolution

4. **Market Position**
   - No other tool offers this level of control
   - Appeals to professional authors
   - Enables complex workflows

### Risk Factors

1. **Complexity Explosion**
   - Writing tool becomes prompt engineering platform
   - Support burden with custom prompts
   - Testing complexity with infinite variations
   - Schema validation challenges

2. **Feature Scope**
   - Model config leads to hosting preferences
   - Custom embeddings requests likely
   - Feature boundaries unclear
   - Escalating complexity

3. **User Experience**
   - Split between power/casual users
   - Debugging complexity
   - Documentation burden
   - Learning curve increase

4. **Technical Risks**
   - Pattern extraction accuracy
   - Storage and performance impact
   - Testing coverage challenges
   - Validation complexity

## Recommendation

### Arguments For
- Unique market position
- Appeals to professional writers
- User control over costs
- Clear IP ownership
- Version controlled prompts
- Series consistency potential

### Arguments Against
- Fundamentally changes product focus
- Makes simple tool complex
- Massive testing burden
- Support nightmare scenario
- Most users won't benefit
- Core value dilution

### Final Position
The prompt customization feature represents a fundamental shift away from our core value proposition of making writing easier. While it offers unique capabilities that would appeal to power users, it transforms PlotWeaver from a writing tool into a prompt engineering platform. The complexity burden on both users and the system is severe, and the benefits are limited to a small subset of users who are willing to become prompt engineers. This feature would actively harm our primary goal of helping authors write, by adding layers of technical complexity that distract from the creative process.
