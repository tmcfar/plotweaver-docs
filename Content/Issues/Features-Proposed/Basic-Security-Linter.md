# Feature: Basic Security Linter

ID: 42
Ref: Security-1

A basic security linter that runs pre-commit to detect common dangerous code patterns in issue processing scripts. Focuses on the top 5 most critical patterns to provide immediate security value with minimal complexity, protecting against code injection and execution vulnerabilities.

## Classification
**Impact:** *Must Have*
**Complexity:** *Small*
**Strategic Value:** *Core*

## User Value
Problem:
- No automated security checks in commit pipeline
- Manual code review misses common security patterns
- Critical vulnerabilities possible from user input
- Inconsistent security practices across codebase

Solution:
- Automated pre-commit security checks
- Immediate feedback on dangerous patterns
- Clear guidance on security fixes
- Zero-config security baseline

## Product Value
Market Impact:
- Demonstrates security-first development
- Builds trust with enterprise clients
- Reduces security incident risk
- Sets foundation for security features

Strategic Alignment:
- Enables secure processing of user content
- Foundation for advanced security features
- Supports enterprise security requirements
- Facilitates security certification process

## Changes Required
- 游릭 scripts/: New security linter script
- 游릭 git/: Pre-commit hook installation
- 游릭 CI: GitHub action integration
- 游릭 docs/: Security check documentation

## Implementation
Dependencies:
- Required: Python runtime, git hooks
- Optional: IDE integration
- Blocking: None

Scope:
- MVP: 5 critical patterns, pre-commit hook
- Boundaries: No auto-fixing, no custom rules
- Future: Pattern configuration, auto-fixes

Integration:
- Pipeline: Pre-commit and CI checks
- Data: No storage required
- Contracts: Exit codes for CI integration

Migration:
- Strategy: Immediate activation on install
- Fallback: Can disable via git config

## Planning Review Outcomes
- 2025-06-28 - Initial proposal approved
- 2025-06-29 - Scope defined to 5 critical patterns

-------------------------------------------
Technical Details:

Security Patterns (HIGH severity):
- eval/exec detection: Prevents arbitrary code execution
- shell=True in os.system/subprocess: Prevents command injection
- unsafe yaml.load without Loader: Prevents code execution via YAML
- raw file operations with user input: Prevents path traversal

Security Patterns (MEDIUM severity):
- f-strings with user input in file operations: Prevents injection

Implementation Approach:
- Regex-based pattern matching for <1s runtime
- Exit code 1 for HIGH severity findings
- File:line reporting with severity
- Pre-commit hook installation script
- CI integration via GitHub Actions
