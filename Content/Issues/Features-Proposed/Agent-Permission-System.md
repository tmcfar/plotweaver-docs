# Feature: Agent Permission System

ID: 44
Ref: Security-2

A comprehensive permission system that enforces strict domain boundaries between agents, preventing unauthorized modifications while ensuring data integrity. Uses a registry-based approach with inheritance support to manage agent permissions and cross-domain interactions.

## Classification
**Impact:** *Must Have*
**Complexity:** *Medium*
**Strategic Value:** *Core*

## User Value
Problem:
- No enforced boundaries between agent domains
- Risk of unauthorized data modifications
- Unclear permission inheritance rules
- Missing audit trail for agent actions

Solution:
- Strict domain boundary enforcement
- Clear permission hierarchy system
- Comprehensive access control
- Complete operation auditing

## Product Value
Market Impact:
- Demonstrates enterprise-grade security
- Enables multi-team agent development
- Supports compliance requirements
- Reduces operational risk

Strategic Alignment:
- Foundation for advanced agent features
- Enables secure third-party integrations
- Supports future agent marketplace
- Core security infrastructure

## Changes Required
- 游리 PermissionManager: Central permission system
- 游리 DomainEnforcer: Boundary control system
- 游릭 AccessRegistry: Permission data store
- 游릭 AuditLogger: Operation tracking
- 游릭 ValidationSystem: Rule enforcement

## Implementation
Dependencies:
- Required: Agent system, logging framework
- Optional: Feature flags
- Blocking: None

Scope:
- MVP: Basic domain boundaries and validation
- Boundaries: No dynamic permissions
- Future: Machine learning-based rules

Integration:
- Pipeline: Pre-operation permission checks
- Data: Permission registry in memory
- Contracts: Agent operation protocols

Migration:
- Strategy: Gradual rollout with feature flags
- Fallback: Disable enforcement per-agent

-------------------------------------------
Technical Details:

Core Components:
- AgentPermissionManager: Validates operations and manages permission registry
  - Operation validation: agent + operation type validation
  - Permission registration: agent-to-domain mapping with allowed operations

- DomainBoundaryEnforcer: Three-part boundary validation
  - Domain access verification
  - Operation type validation against domain
  - Interaction rule verification
  - DomainViolationError handling for breaches

- AccessControlRegistry: Permission data structure and inheritance
  - Domain scoping for permissions
  - Operation type whitelisting
  - Interaction rule definitions
  - Optional permission inheritance chains

Permission System:
- Domain-based boundary enforcement with explicit violation handling
- Operation-level permission validation with type checking
- Rule-based cross-agent interaction control system
