# Feature: Intelligent Quality Orchestration (Consolidated)

ID: 55/56
Ref: Quality-1/Quality-2

An intelligent quality orchestration system that reduces quality loop iterations by 60% through smart restart decisions and impact-based management. Analyzes change impact to selectively restart only affected agents, preventing unnecessary LLM calls while maintaining 95% quality standards with sub-200ms decision time.

## Planning Review Outcomes

-------------------------------------------
Technical Details:

Core Components:
- BasicQualityOrchestrator:
  - should_restart(changes: List[AgentChange]) -> RestartDecision:
    - NO_RESTART: No changes or minor typos
    - FULL_RESTART: Plot modifications
    - SELECTIVE_RESTART: Default safe choice
  - Decision Categories:
    - minor_typo handling
    - plot_modification detection
    - change type analysis

- QualityLoopManager:
  - Safety Features:
    - Maximum 3 restart cycles per scene
    - Dependency matrix for chains
    - Human review fallbacks
    - Loop detection

- ChangeImpactAnalyzer:
  - Capabilities:
    - Change scope detection
    - Dependency identification
    - Severity classification
    - Downstream analysis

Implementation Strategy:
Phase 1 - Basic Orchestration (2-3 months):
- Basic restart limits
- Simple change categorization
- Agent category rules
- Comprehensive logging

Performance Targets:
- 40%+ reduction in unnecessary iterations
- Zero quality degradation
- 60-second generation improvement
- Reliable tracing capability

Risk Controls:
- False Negatives:
  - Conservative defaults
  - When in doubt, restart more
  - Clear override paths
  - Comprehensive logging

Detailed Analysis:

Inefficiency Example:
1. SceneWriterAgent generates scene
2. SettingEnrichmentAgent adds environmental details
3. CharacterVoiceAgent tweaks one line of dialogue
4. Current System: All subsequent agents re-run (unnecessary)
5. Smart System: Only agents affected by dialogue change re-run

Cost Impact:
- Current: 6 agents Ã— $0.10 per validation = $0.60 per minor change
- Optimized: 2 agents Ã— $0.10 per validation = $0.20 per minor change
- Potential savings: 60-70% on quality loop costs

Implementation Complexity:
- Change Detection Challenge:
  - Dialogue impact on atmosphere
  - Emotional state effects
  - Cross-agent dependencies
  - Context sensitivity

- Dependency Mapping Example:
  ```python
  # Complexity grows quickly with each condition
  if change_type == "dialogue":
      affected_agents = ["CharacterVoiceAgent"]
      if dialogue_reveals_emotion():
          affected_agents.append("CharacterBodyLanguageAgent")
      if dialogue_contradicts_setting():
          affected_agents.append("AtmosphericContinuityAgent")
      # etc...
  ```

Alternative Approaches:

Option 1: Time-Based Limits
- Simple Rule: Limit quality loops to 2 iterations
- Pros: Easy to implement, prevents infinite loops
- Cons: Less sophisticated than full impact analysis

Option 2: Agent-Specific Budgets
- Rule: Each agent can trigger restart only once per scene
- Pros: Distributed control, prevents single agent loops
- Cons: May miss legitimate quality issues

Option 3: Human Decision Points
- Rule: After 2 automatic iterations, present options to author
- Pros: Ultimate quality control, clear stopping point
- Cons: Interrupts workflow, requires decisions

Option 4: Staged Restart Logic (Recommended)
- Stage 1: Basic restart limits
- Stage 2: Agent categories
- Stage 3: Content-aware decisions

Warning Signs to Abort:
- Quality regressions hard to trace
- Restart logic more complex than agent logic
- User complaints about inconsistency
- Development time exceeds 4 months

Future Enhancement Criteria:
- Phase 1 demonstrates clear value
- User feedback indicates need
- Technical team confident in analysis
- Business case justifies complexity

Business Impact Analysis:
- Current Cost Structure:
  - Per scene: 6 agents Ã— $0.10 Ã— 2.5 iterations = $1.50
  - Per novel: 50 scenes Ã— $1.50 = $75 quality loop cost
  - Annual cost: 100 novels = $7,500 quality processing

- Optimized Costs:
  - 60% reduction in iterations
  - $30 savings per novel
  - $3,000 annual savings potential

- ROI Considerations:
  - Break-even point: 100+ novels
  - Development cost recovery period: ~4 months
  - Improved user experience value
  - Lower priority vs. core features
