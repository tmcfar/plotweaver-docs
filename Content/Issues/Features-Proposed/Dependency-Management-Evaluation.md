| **TOTAL** | | | **6.35/10** | |

## Feature Description

**Core Problem:** In long-form series (10+ books), authors struggle to maintain consistency across:
- World rules (magic systems, physics, geography)
- Character continuity (relationships, backstory, growth arcs)
- Plot threads (multi-book prophecies, unresolved conflicts)
- Timeline integrity (ages, historical events, seasonal cycles)

**Proposed Solution:** Automated dependency tracking system that:
1. Identifies core elements that must remain consistent
2. Tracks relationships between story components
3. Flags potential conflicts during generation
4. Suggests resolution strategies for conflicts

## Technical Approach

### Dependency Graph Structure
```yaml
# Example dependency definition
character_dependencies:
  elena_martinez:
    core_traits: ["magical_sensitivity", "fear_of_heights"] 
    relationships:
      - target: "marcus_mentor"
        type: "teacher_student"
        established_in: "book_1_chapter_3"
    constraints:
      - "cannot_use_fire_magic"  # established limitation
      
world_dependencies:
  magic_system:
    rules:
      - "magic_depletes_life_force"
      - "maximum_3_elements_per_person"
    violations_cause: "world_consistency_error"
```

### Change Impact Analysis
```python
def analyze_change_impact(proposed_change: dict) -> ImpactReport:
    """Determine which existing content conflicts with proposed change"""
    affected_scenes = find_dependent_scenes(proposed_change)
    conflict_severity = assess_conflict_level(affected_scenes)
    resolution_options = generate_resolution_strategies(conflicts)
    return ImpactReport(affected_scenes, conflict_severity, resolution_options)
```

## Benefits

### For Authors
- **Consistency Assurance**: Automatic detection of world-building violations
- **Series Planning**: Visual dependency maps for complex story arcs  
- **Change Management**: Impact analysis before making major plot changes
- **Timeline Integrity**: Automatic age progression and seasonal tracking

### For PlotWeaver
- **Market Differentiation**: First tool designed for series consistency
- **User Retention**: Authors can't easily switch tools mid-series
- **Premium Pricing**: Professional feature justifies higher subscription tiers

## Risks & Challenges

### Technical Risks
1. **Dependency Hell**: Complex circular dependencies may be unresolvable
2. **False Positives**: System may flag intentional inconsistencies as errors
3. **Performance Impact**: Dependency checking could slow generation significantly
4. **Edge Case Handling**: Real novels have messy, organic inconsistencies

### User Experience Risks
1. **Overwhelm**: Too many dependency warnings could paralyze authors
2. **Rigidity**: System might discourage creative plot developments
3. **Learning Curve**: Complex dependency concepts may confuse casual users

### Implementation Complexity
- **Effort Estimate**: 6-12 months for basic version
- **Ongoing Maintenance**: High - requires constant edge case handling
- **Testing Complexity**: Difficult to test all dependency scenarios

## Staged Implementation Plan

### Stage 1: Basic Tracking (3 months)
- Character trait consistency
- Simple world rule violations
- Manual dependency definition

### Stage 2: Relationship Mapping (3 months)  
- Character relationship tracking
- Plot thread continuity
- Basic timeline validation

### Stage 3: Advanced Analysis (6 months)
- Automated dependency inference
- Impact analysis for changes
- Resolution strategy suggestions

### Stage 4: Series Management (Ongoing)
- Cross-book dependency tracking
- Multi-timeline support
- Advanced conflict resolution

## Alternative Approaches

### Manual Dependency Management
- **Pros**: Simpler to implement, full author control
- **Cons**: Requires extensive manual work, error-prone

### Warning-Only System
- **Pros**: Less intrusive, easier to implement
- **Cons**: Doesn't actively prevent inconsistencies

### Third-Party Integration
- **Pros**: Leverage existing tools (Aeon Timeline, World Anvil)
- **Cons**: Breaks PlotWeaver's integrated experience

## Recommendation

**PROCEED with staged implementation**, starting with basic character trait tracking. This feature addresses a genuine pain point for series authors and provides strong market differentiation.

**Critical Success Factors:**
1. Start simple - basic consistency checking only
2. Provide easy override mechanisms for intentional inconsistencies  
3. Focus on most common dependency types first
4. Gather extensive user feedback during Stage 1

**Warning Signs to Watch:**
- Implementation taking longer than 6 months for Stage 1
- User complaints about false positives >20%
- Performance degradation >2x in generation time
- Development team expressing uncertainty about technical approach

**Next Steps:**
1. Create detailed technical specification for Stage 1
2. Prototype basic character trait tracking
3. User research on most critical dependency types
4. Performance impact assessment
