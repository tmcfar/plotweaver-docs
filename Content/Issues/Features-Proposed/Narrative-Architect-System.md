# Feature: Narrative Architect System

ID: 50
Ref: AI-1

A cost-optimizing two-tier AI system where an expensive "Narrative Architect" model plans complex narrative changes and cheaper "Executor" models implement specific edits. Uses intelligent activation thresholds and dependency analysis to achieve 60-80% cost reduction while improving narrative coherence.
