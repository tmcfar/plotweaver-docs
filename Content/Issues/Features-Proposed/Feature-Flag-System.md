# Feature: Feature Flag System

ID: 45
Ref: Deployment-1

A comprehensive feature flag infrastructure enabling safe staged rollouts and A/B testing. Provides granular control over feature deployment with context-aware evaluation, supporting data-driven feature development while maintaining sub-100ms performance.

## Classification
**Impact:** *Must Have*
**Complexity:** *Medium*
**Strategic Value:** *Core*

- Fine-grained deployment control
- Built-in A/B testing
- Usage analytics integration

## Product Value
Market Impact:
- Enables data-driven development
- Reduces deployment risk
- Supports rapid iteration
- Enables customer segmentation

Strategic Alignment:
- Foundation for experimentation
- Enables progressive delivery
- Supports customer customization
- Core deployment infrastructure

## Changes Required
