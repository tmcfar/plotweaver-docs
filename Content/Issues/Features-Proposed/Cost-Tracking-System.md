# Feature: Cost Tracking System

ID: 43
Ref: Metrics-1

A comprehensive cost tracking and analytics system that monitors LLM usage across all agents. Enables ROI validation, cost optimization, and transparent billing while providing data to validate 40-60% cost reduction claims through precise per-request tracking and analysis.

## Classification
**Impact:** *Must Have*
**Complexity:** *Medium*
**Strategic Value:** *Core*

## User Value
Problem:
- No visibility into per-request LLM costs
- Cannot validate cost reduction claims
- Manual cost tracking is error-prone
- Difficult to optimize usage patterns

Solution:
- Real-time cost tracking per request
- Automated usage optimization suggestions
- Accurate cost prediction and budgeting
- Transparent cost breakdown by feature

## Product Value
Market Impact:
- Validates cost-saving claims with data
- Attracts cost-conscious enterprise clients
- Differentiates with usage optimization
- Enables transparent usage-based pricing

Strategic Alignment:
- Foundation for cost optimization features
- Enables ROI-driven development decisions
- Supports enterprise billing requirements
- Critical for cost reduction roadmap

## Changes Required
- 游리 CostEngine: New tracking infrastructure
- 游리 Analytics: Usage pattern detection
- 游릭 Storage: Cost record persistence
- 游릭 API: Cost tracking endpoints
- 游릭 UI: Basic cost dashboard

## Implementation
Dependencies:
- Required: Token counting, rate management
- Optional: Billing system integration
- Blocking: None

Scope:
- MVP: Per-request tracking, basic analytics
- Boundaries: No auto-scaling, no alerts
- Future: ML-based optimization, alerts

Integration:
- Pipeline: Hook into request lifecycle
- Data: Cost records in time-series DB
- Contracts: Cost tracking interfaces

Migration:
- Strategy: Shadow mode for validation
- Fallback: Disable tracking per-request

## Planning Review Outcomes
