# Feature: Progressive Setting System

ID: 49
Ref: Setting-1

A progressive setting elaboration system that evolves with the story using a three-tier approach. Combines genre defaults, user overrides, and dynamically discovered details to balance worldbuilding depth with writing flow, using intelligent caching and version control.

## Classification
**Impact:** *Must Have*
**Complexity:** *Large*
