## Feature Description

### Core Concept
Dynamic agent spawning based on project complexity, allowing PlotWeaver to scale computational resources precisely to match story needs. Instead of fixed agent assignments, the system spawns specialized agents based on actual requirements.

Current vs Proposed approach:
```python
# Static (Current)
Every project gets:
- 1 CharacterAgent (handles 3 or 300 characters)
- 1 SettingAgent (modern town or galactic empire)
- Fixed computational overhead

# Elastic (Proposed)
Project complexity determines:
- 0-N CharacterAgents (scale with cast size)
- 0-N SettingAgents (scale with world complexity)
- Adaptive quality validation
- Pay for what you use
```

### Key Components

1. **Dynamic Agent Spawning**
   - Analyze project complexity (character count, world size, etc.)
   - Spawn appropriate number and type of agents
   - Scale resources based on actual needs
   ```python
   if complexity.character_count < 5:
       agents.append(MinimalCharacterAgent())
   elif complexity.character_count < 20:
       agents.append(StandardCharacterAgent())
   else:
       agents.extend([
           ProtagonistAgent(),
           SupportingCastAgent(count=complexity.character_count//10),
           BackgroundCastAgent()
       ])
   ```

2. **Temperature-Based Character Modeling**
   - Match AI temperature to character personality
   - Customize agent behavior per character
   - Example mappings:
     - Unpredictable characters: 0.9 temperature
     - Methodical characters: 0.3 temperature
     - Default characters: 0.5 temperature

3. **Complexity Analysis via Digital Humanities**
   - Quantify project metrics:
     - Location count
     - Character count
     - Culture count
     - Detail depth
     - Cross-references
     - Terminology density
     - Concept introduction rate

4. **PromptWriter Meta-Agent**
   - Dynamically generate specialized agent prompts
   - Base templates with specialization
   - Model selection based on complexity
   - Lifecycle management

## Detailed Analysis

### Core Benefits
1. **Cost Efficiency**
   - 60-80% savings for simple projects
   - Pay-for-what-you-use model
   - Automatic downscaling at budget thresholds

2. **Quality Scaling**
   - Complex projects get needed resources
   - Specialized agents for specific tasks
   - Better consistency tracking

3. **Flexibility**
   - Agents adapt to project evolution
   - Real-time resource adjustment
   - Configuration presets available

### Risk Factors

1. **Coordination Overhead**
   - Complex agent orchestration
   - Communication protocol design
   - Distributed system debugging
   - State management across agents

2. **PromptWriter Reliability**
   - Dynamic prompt generation quality
   - Template maintenance
   - Fallback mechanisms needed
   - Testing complexity

3. **User Experience**
   - Configuration complexity
   - Cost unpredictability
   - Resource management learning curve
   - Performance variability

4. **System Complexity**
   - Debugging distributed agents
   - State synchronization
   - Resource allocation
   - Error handling across agent network

## Recommendation

### Arguments For
- Significant cost optimization potential
- Better handling of complex projects
- Dynamic resource allocation
- Pay-for-what-you-use model
- Future-proof architecture
- Unique market differentiation

### Arguments Against
- Major increase in system complexity
- High debugging and maintenance burden
- Risk of confusing users
- Current fixed system is stable
- Could delay other critical features
- Requires distributed systems expertise

### Final Position
While the elastic architecture offers compelling benefits in resource optimization and project scalability, recommend deferring until core system stability is achieved. The current fixed agent system is working well, and the complexity risks outweigh immediate benefits. Revisit after core features are stable and we have more user feedback on scaling pain points.
