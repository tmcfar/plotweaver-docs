# Technical Specification: File Upload System

## Overview
Implement a secure, cloud-based file upload system with virus scanning and format validation capabilities. The system will handle multiple file types, provide upload status feedback, and manage access controls.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Support uploads of images (JPG, PNG, GIF), documents (PDF, DOCX), and videos (MP4, MOV)
- Maximum file size: 100MB per file
- Virus scanning for all uploaded files
- Generate thumbnails for image files
- Real-time upload progress indication
- Role-based access control for file management

### Technical Requirements
- AWS S3 for file storage
- ClamAV integration for virus scanning
- JWT-based authentication
- API rate limiting
- HTTPS encryption for all transfers

## Technical Approach

### Architecture
1. Frontend
   - React-based upload component
   - Progress bar implementation using XHR/Fetch
   - Chunk-based upload for large files

2. Backend
   - RESTful API endpoints for upload/download
   - File processing queue using Redis
   - S3 pre-signed URLs for secure uploads

### Implementation Steps
1. Set up S3 bucket with appropriate CORS and security policies
2. Implement file validation middleware
3. Create virus scanning service with ClamAV
4. Develop thumbnail generation service
5. Implement access control layer
6. Add monitoring and logging

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for validation logic
- Integration tests for file processing
- Load testing for concurrent uploads
- Security testing for access controls

### Success Metrics
- Upload success rate > 99%
- Scan completion < 30 seconds
- Thumbnail generation < 10 seconds
