## Feature Description

**Core Problem:** Authors face worldbuilding overwhelm - either they:
1. Front-load extensive worldbuilding (paralysis, burnout)
2. Wing it completely (inconsistency, plot holes)
3. Get bogged down researching details mid-writing (flow disruption)

**Solution:** Three-tier progressive elaboration system that grows setting detail organically as the story demands it.

## Three-Tier Architecture

### Tier 1: Genre Templates (Automatic)
**Purpose**: Provide sensible defaults without user effort
```yaml
# templates/fantasy/tavern.yaml
location_template:
  type: "tavern"
  sensory_defaults:
    sounds: ["conversation", "laughter", "clinking mugs"]
    smells: ["ale", "woodsmoke", "food"]
    lighting: ["firelight", "lanterns", "dim_corners"]
  atmosphere_options: ["rowdy", "quiet", "mysterious", "tense"]
  typical_occupants: ["locals", "travelers", "merchants"]
```

### Tier 2: User Customization (Optional)
**Purpose**: Capture major deviations from genre norms
```yaml
# world/customizations/taverns.yaml
user_overrides:
  tavern_default:
    smells: ["incense", "exotic_spices"]  # Cultural modification
    atmosphere: "always_suspicious"       # Unique to this world
    special_rules: ["no_weapons_allowed"] # Setting-specific law
```

### Tier 3: Just-in-Time Discovery (Dynamic)
**Purpose**: Generate specific details when scenes need them
```python
def get_location_for_scene(self, location_ref: str, scene_context: dict) -> Location:
    # Check if specific instance exists
    if self.location_exists(location_ref):
        return self.get_location(location_ref)
        
    # Generate from template + customizations + scene context
    template = self.get_template(location_type)
    customizations = self.get_user_overrides(location_type)
    instance = self.generate_instance(template, customizations, scene_context)
    
    # Store for consistency across future scenes
    self.store_location(location_ref, instance)
    return instance
```

## User Workflow Benefits

### For New Authors
1. **No Setup Required**: Genre template provides immediate sensible defaults
2. **Write First**: Can start writing scenes without extensive worldbuilding
3. **Organic Growth**: World detail emerges naturally from story needs

### For Experienced Authors  
1. **Customization Power**: Override defaults for unique worlds
2. **Consistency Tracking**: System remembers details across scenes
3. **Scalability**: Supports complex multi-book series

### Example User Journey
```
Day 1: Author selects "fantasy" genre, starts writing
      → Tavern scene auto-uses default fantasy tavern template

Day 3: Author wants unique cultural element
      → Adds override: taverns in this world burn sacred herbs

Day 10: Scene needs "The Prancing Pony" specifically  
       → System generates instance with default + overrides + scene context
       → Stores instance for future consistency

Day 50: Different scene returns to Prancing Pony
       → System retrieves stored instance, maintains consistency
```

## Technical Implementation

### SettingRepository Pattern
```python
class SettingRepository:
    """Progressive elaboration for settings"""
    
    def __init__(self, project_root: Path):
        self.templates = self._load_genre_templates()
        self.user_overrides = self._load_user_customizations()
        self.instances = self._load_discovered_instances()
        self.cache = LRUCache(maxsize=100)
    
    def get_location_for_scene(self, location_type: str, context: dict) -> dict:
        # Check cache first
        cache_key = f"{location_type}:{hash(str(context))}"
        if cache_key in self.cache:
            return self.cache[cache_key]
            
        # Build layered configuration
        base = self.templates.get(location_type, {})
        overrides = self.user_overrides.get(location_type, {})
        instance = self._merge_configs(base, overrides, context)
        
        # Cache and return
        self.cache[cache_key] = instance
        return instance
```

### Template Inheritance System
```yaml
# templates/fantasy/base_location.yaml
base_location:
  environmental:
    weather_affects: true
    time_of_day_matters: true
  cultural:
    social_hierarchy: "medieval_fantasy"
    
# templates/fantasy/tavern.yaml
inherits: "base_location"
location_specific:
  function: "social_gathering"
  typical_events: ["meals", "gossip", "deals", "fights"]
```

## Implementation Benefits

### Solves Real Problems
1. **Worldbuilding Paralysis**: Authors can start writing immediately
2. **Consistency Maintenance**: System tracks details automatically  
3. **Organic Development**: World grows with story naturally
4. **Series Scalability**: Supports multi-book consistency

### Technical Advantages
1. **Performance**: Only generates details when needed
2. **Storage Efficiency**: Minimal git storage for maximum world depth
3. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new templates and location types
4. **User Control**: Authors can override any defaults

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk: Generic Templates
**Problem**: Default templates might feel bland or stereotypical
**Mitigation**: 
- Provide multiple template variations per genre
- Easy customization system for unique elements
- Community template sharing (future)

### Risk: Context Misinterpretation  
**Problem**: System might generate inappropriate details for scene context
**Mitigation**:
- Conservative defaults that work in most contexts
- User review and edit capabilities
- Manual override options

### Risk: Complexity Creep
**Problem**: Template system could become overly complex
**Mitigation**:
- Start with simple templates (5-10 location types)
- Add complexity based on user feedback
- Clear inheritance hierarchies

## Competitive Analysis

### World Anvil
**Strengths**: Comprehensive worldbuilding tools
**Weaknesses**: Front-loads complexity, separate from writing tool

### Scrivener + Templates
**Strengths**: Integrated with writing environment  
**Weaknesses**: Static templates, no dynamic generation

### PlotWeaver Advantage
- **Dynamic Generation**: Creates details just-in-time
- **Integrated Workflow**: Seamless with scene writing
- **Progressive Complexity**: Grows with author needs
- **Series Consistency**: Tracks details across books
