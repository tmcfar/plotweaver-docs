## Feature Description

**Proposed Five-Agent Hierarchy**:

1. **WorldPhysicsAgent** (merged Geography + Systems)
2. **LocationsAgent** (specific places and features)
3. **CulturePoliticsAgent** (merged Culture + Politics)  
4. **HistoryAgent** (timeline and historical events)
5. **SettingStyleAgent** (narrative voice and linguistic patterns)

**Key Innovation**: User-driven importance ratings (High/Medium/Low/Skip) determine which agents run and how detailed their output becomes.

## Agent Analysis

### WorldPhysicsAgent
**Function**: Physical world rules, natural laws, environmental systems  
**Output**: Climate patterns, terrain, natural resources, magic/tech rules, physics constraints  
**Templates**: "Earth-like Physics", "High Magic World", "Hard Sci-Fi Universe", "Hybrid Reality"

**Evaluation**:
- **Strong Rationale**: Physics and geography are foundational to everything else
- **Clear Scope**: Objective, rule-based content with fewer subjective decisions
- **High Impact**: Affects every scene and character interaction
- **User Control**: Authors can skip for contemporary fiction, prioritize for fantasy/sci-fi

### LocationsAgent  
**Function**: Specific places and detailed geographical features  
**Output**: Cities, buildings, regions, landmarks, travel routes  
**Templates**: "Medieval Towns", "Modern Cities", "Fantasy Realms", "Space Stations"  
**Progressive Mode**: Creates locations just-in-time as scenes reference them

**Evaluation**:
- **Essential Function**: Every scene needs a location
- **Progressive Benefit**: Generate only what's needed, when needed
- **Clear Boundary**: Physical places vs cultural/political systems
- **Strong Template Potential**: Location types are well-understood across genres

### CulturePoliticsAgent (Merged)
**Function**: Societies, governments, belief systems, power structures  
**Output**: Cultural profiles, political systems, social hierarchies, traditions, conflicts  
**Templates**: "Medieval Feudalism", "Corporate Dystopia", "Tribal Federation", "Democratic Republic"

**Evaluation**:
- **Merger Makes Sense**: Culture and politics are tightly interrelated
- **High Complexity**: Most subjective and nuanced of the five agents
- **Variable Importance**: Critical for some genres, less so for others
- **Template Challenge**: Cultural systems are harder to generalize than locations

### HistoryAgent  
**Function**: Timeline creation, historical events, cause-and-effect chains  
**Output**: Historical timelines, past events affecting current story, foundational myths  
**Templates**: "Ancient Civilizations", "Recent Conflicts", "Technological Evolution", "Magical History"

**Evaluation**:
- **Clear Value**: History drives character motivations and plot constraints
- **Scope Concern**: Could easily become overwhelming if not constrained
- **Template Strength**: Historical patterns are well-understood
- **Series Benefit**: Essential for multi-book consistency

### SettingStyleAgent
**Function**: Narrative style elements and world-specific linguistic patterns  
**Output**: Dialect patterns, fantasy terminology, cultural speech patterns, narrative voice rules  
**Examples**: Formal address systems, magic terminology consistency, cultural idioms

**Evaluation**:
- **Unique Niche**: No other agent handles linguistic worldbuilding
- **Quality Impact**: Affects consistency across all dialogue and narrative
- **Implementation Challenge**: Most abstract and hardest to template
- **User Expertise**: Authors may want direct control over stylistic choices

## User-Driven Importance System

### Proposed Rating System
- **High**: Agent runs with detailed output, creates comprehensive templates
- **Medium**: Agent runs with moderate detail, focuses on story-relevant elements
- **Low**: Agent creates minimal framework, can be expanded later
- **Skip**: Agent doesn't run, uses genre defaults only

### Example User Workflow
**Epic Fantasy Author**:
- WorldPhysicsAgent: **High** (complex magic system)
- LocationsAgent: **Medium** (several kingdoms and cities)
- CulturePoliticsAgent: **High** (complex political intrigue)
- HistoryAgent: **Medium** (relevant backstory)
- SettingStyleAgent: **Low** (standard fantasy conventions)

**Contemporary Thriller Author**:
- WorldPhysicsAgent: **Skip** (real-world physics)
- LocationsAgent: **High** (specific city neighborhoods matter)
- CulturePoliticsAgent: **Low** (contemporary American culture)
- HistoryAgent: **Skip** (current day setting)
- SettingStyleAgent: **Medium** (genre-specific terminology)

## Technical Implementation

### Agent Coordination
```python
class SettingAgentCoordinator:
    def run_setting_phase(self, user_preferences: SettingPreferences):
        results = {}
        
        # Run agents in dependency order
        if user_preferences.world_physics != "skip":
            results["physics"] = self.world_physics_agent.execute(
                detail_level=user_preferences.world_physics
            )
        
        if user_preferences.locations != "skip":
            results["locations"] = self.locations_agent.execute(
                detail_level=user_preferences.locations,
                physics_context=results.get("physics")
            )
        
        # Continue with other agents...
        return results
```

### Template Integration
**Hierarchy**: Genre Templates → User Customizations → Agent Generation
- **Genre Templates**: Pre-built packages for common genres
- **User Customizations**: Override specific elements
- **Agent Generation**: Fill in details based on importance rating

## Benefits Analysis

### For Authors
1. **Customizable Complexity**: Choose depth level per worldbuilding aspect
2. **Systematic Coverage**: Ensures no major worldbuilding gaps
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Can increase detail later as story develops
4. **Genre Flexibility**: Works for fantasy epics and contemporary fiction

### For PlotWeaver  
1. **Competitive Differentiation**: No other tool provides systematic worldbuilding coordination
2. **User Retention**: Complex projects become manageable
3. **Professional Appeal**: Structured approach appeals to serious authors
4. **Series Foundation**: Essential for multi-book consistency

## Implementation Concerns

### Agent Coordination Complexity
**Challenge**: Ensuring agents don't contradict each other
**Solution**: Clear dependency hierarchy and shared context validation

### Template Quality
**Challenge**: Creating useful templates that aren't generic or stereotypical
**Solution**: Multiple template variations per genre, user customization options

### User Interface Complexity  
**Challenge**: Making importance rating system intuitive
**Solution**: Smart defaults based on genre, clear explanations of agent functions

### Scope Creep Risk
**Challenge**: Agents could generate overwhelming amounts of detail
**Solution**: Strict word/element limits based on importance rating

## Alternative Approaches

### Single SettingAgent
**Pros**: Simpler coordination, holistic worldbuilding
**Cons**: Harder to customize depth per aspect, monolithic complexity

### Template-Only System
**Pros**: Simple, fast, predictable
**Cons**: Less dynamic, doesn't adapt to specific story needs

### User-Directed Worldbuilding
**Pros**: Complete author control
**Cons**: Overwhelming for many authors, doesn't solve the core problem

- Template system provides useful starting points for 80% of use cases

## Recommendation: PROCEED

**Strong Justification**:
1. **Addresses Real Pain Point**: Worldbuilding overwhelm is genuine problem for many authors
2. **Natural Extension**: Builds logically on progressive settings foundation
3. **User-Driven Complexity**: Authors control depth, avoiding forced sophistication
4. **Clear Agent Boundaries**: Well-defined domains minimize coordination complexity

**Critical Success Factors**:
1. **Start with 2-3 agents** (WorldPhysics, Locations) and prove value
2. **Focus on template quality** over comprehensive coverage
3. **User testing throughout** to validate importance rating system
4. **Performance monitoring** to ensure reasonable generation times

**Implementation Priority**: Core component of Phase 5 (Progressive Settings)

**Next Steps**:
1. **Design user preference interface** for importance ratings
2. **Create initial template library** for WorldPhysicsAgent and LocationsAgent  
3. **Prototype agent coordination logic** with conflict detection
4. **User interviews** with fantasy/sci-fi authors about worldbuilding workflows
