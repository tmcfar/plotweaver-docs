--message "Please populate the Feature-Analysis.md with a comprehensive list of all proposed features from the Features-Proposed directory. 

For each feature:
- Extract core functionality and purpose
- Include Impact, Complexity, and Strategic Value ratings
- Note key dependencies and integration points
- Preserve implementation scope boundaries
- List technical components affected

Do not conduct analysis or make recommendations - this document should serve as a structured inventory of all proposed features for future evaluation.

Organize features by their strategic categories (Core/Growth/Enhancement) to facilitate later prioritization discussions.

Ensure all details are preserved but formatted consistently for easy review."
