# Feature Template

ID: [number]
Ref: [reference if applicable]

[1-12 line description focusing on what the feature enables for users and why it matters to the product. Explain the problem being solved and how this creates value.]

## Classification
**Impact:** *[Must Have | Should Have | Could Have | Won't Have]*
**Complexity:** *[Small | Medium | Large | Extreme]*
**Strategic Value:** *[Core | Growth | Enhancement | Optional]*

Complexity Legend:
- Small: Single component, clear scope
- Medium: Multiple components, manageable dependencies
- Large: System-wide impact, complex dependencies
- Extreme: 丘멆잺 Architectural overhaul - requires scope reduction before consideration

## User Value
Problem:
- What user pain point or need does this address?
- How do users currently handle this?
- Why is current solution insufficient?

Solution:
- How does this solve the problem?
- What becomes possible?
- Why is this better?

## Product Value
Market Impact:
- How does this differentiate the product?
- What capabilities does it enable?
- Who does this attract?

Strategic Alignment:
- How does this advance product vision?
- What future capabilities does it enable?
- What becomes possible after this?
